    "\n",
    "The requirements for the minimum viable product (as defined in the official project documentation) are as follows:\n",
    " - The MVP should be developed in Python, within Jupyter notebooks so as to show how the findemntal concept behind this has been built\n",
    " - the MVP should utilise pandas and SKLearn to vectorise and classify the fake and real news data\n",
    " - Train the algorithm on 75% of the real-fake data\n",
    " - Create a passive aggressive classifier and test it on the remaining 25% \n",
    " - Print a confusion matrix on that test\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy of the model through the data in the confusion matrix\n",
    " - Calculate K Fold accuracy to see how it compares\n",
    " - Test the passive aggressive nature of the model against the other real and fake news datasets\n",
    " - Calculate accuracy for these other datasets\n",
    " - Report on the accuracies and how the MVP can be changed/improved for the first version\n",
    " \n",
    "This MVP will allow us to see whether the concept is feasible and what we can build off upon. I have an expectation of a low accuracy for my classifier (anywhere between 40% - 50%) I can proceed to justify why it is so low and suggest ideas for improvement"

I believe that accuracies like 69% and 71% accuracy on foreign datasets proves that this model works well. I will work to make this algorithm more accuracte through support vector machining and neural networks. The requirement for the first version includes research on defining attributes of fake and real news articles. I will be able to use neural networks and support vector machines to classify the data with these attributes. I can test whether adding these classifications increases or decreases the accuracy of my model.\n",
